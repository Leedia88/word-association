# Word-association

Simple Word Game to improve my Javascript skills and practice the basics.

In the word association game, you are given three words and then have to choose one of 
two options that are associated with the three given words. 

The Jeopardy game has been adapted to work well for one player:
* You score points by answering questions correctly.
* The total amount of points is based on the amount of correct and wrong answers you choose.
